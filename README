Based off the blog https://run.tournament.org.il/ubuntu-18-04-and-tpm2-encrypted-system-disk/

Written for Ubuntu 18.04, but should be general since it uses standard tools from tpm2-tools package. Newer versions could/should use clevis-tpm2.

Appropriate for one-off uses that don't need to manage any other TPM resources.

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Modify create_tpm_key.sh parameters
2. sudo ./create_tpm_key.sh
3. Folow remaining instructions, modify to suit system
