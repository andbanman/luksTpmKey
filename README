Based off the blog https://run.tournament.org.il/ubuntu-18-04-and-tpm2-encrypted-system-disk/

Written for Ubuntu 18.04, but should be general since it uses standard tools from tpm2-tools package. Newer versions could/should use clevis-tpm2.

Appropriate for:
- Decrypting non-root LUKS drives during boot
- One-off uses that don't need to manage any other TPM resources
